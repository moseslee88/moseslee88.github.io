    <title>DIFFERENCE between switch and if-else</title>
  </head>
  <body> 
    What is the difference between ‘switch’ and ‘if/else’? When would you use one versus
the other?

<p> While both are considered CONTROL FLOW statements, a 'switch' statement is a little more complex than 
a "if else" one. The -if else" statement is the most basic of all control flow statements.  A 'switch' statement executes
much faster than an 'if/else' statement. A program will only execute a certain section of code only if a particular test 
evaluates to be true. For example, in exercise 20 of Learning Java the 
  Hard Way (the one about UT Austin College Admissions), </p>

import static java.lang.System.*;<br/>
import java.util.Scanner;<br/><br/>

public class CollegeAdmission {<br/>
  public static void main( String[] args ) {<br/>
    Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);<br/>
    int math;<br/><br/>

    out.println( "Welcome to the UT Austin College Admissions Interface!" );<br/>
    out.println( "Please enter your SAT math score (200-800): ");<br/>
    math = keyboard.nextInt();<br/><br/>

    out.print( "Admittance status: " );<br/><br/>

    if ( math >= 790 )<br/>
      out.print( "CERTAIN" );  <br/>
    else if ( math >= 710 )<br/>
      out.print( "SAFE" );<br/>
    else if ( math >= 580 )<br/>
      out.print( "PROBABLE" );<br/>
    else if ( math >= 500 )<br/>
      out.print( "UNCERTAIN" );<br/><br/>
      
<p> If someone scores a 720 on their Sat, thereby making the first if statement FALSE, then this particular if/else
provides a secondary path of execution (in line 27 above), since the first if statement is false. This will make the student feel "safe"
about their chances of getting admitted into UT Austin, but not certain. As putting an else in front of
an if statement makes it defer to the previous if statement, the program will execute the code only up to the 
point where the if statement is still true. A value of a variable can satisfy more than one condition, but the program
  will only execute the appropriate statements until the conditions are evaluated to be false.</p>

<p> In a switch statement, unlike the if/else statement, the switch can have many, many possible execution paths.  A switch 
statement doesn't evaluate to be true or false; rather, it executes all the statements that follow its "Case." Switch
statements include switch blocks, and they all include break statements. Each break statement terminates the enclosing 
switch statement. DETERMINING whether to use a 'switch' statement or an 'if/else' statement depends of the expression 
that the statement is testing. An 'if/else' statement can text expressions based on a wide range of conditions, while 'Switch'
statements can only deal with expressions based on a single integer or String object, or enumerated value. Basically, the main 
difference is that switch dispatches immediately to the case concerned, typically via an indexed jump, rather than having to 
evaluate all the conditions that would be required in all the nested statements in an if-else chain, which means that code at 
the end of the chain is reached more slowly than code at the beginning. A 'switch' statement can't handle all datatypes, and in
a 'switch' statement, all the case values have to be constant. Since the program only has to decide which case has to be 
  executed in a 'switch' statement, they <br/> usually execute much faster than 'if/else' statements.  </p>
